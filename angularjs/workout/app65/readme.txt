## Problem

	AngularJS jQuery integration

## Solution

	The first challenge is a mindset change, a paradigm shift. With frameworks such as jQuery, we work at DOM level whereas with AngularJS we work with models and controllers that require no DOM manipulation.

	Angular way: 
	
		AngularJS is a framework, jQuery is a library
		Model drives the view
		Stop thinking in terms of the selector
		It's not about DOM manipulation
		Views are declarative
		Data-binding is awesome, embrace it
		Directives replace plugins
		Avoid mixing both worlds
