		// Local variable
		// A function can access all variables defined inside the function
		// A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code.
		function myFunction() {
		    var a = 4;
		    return a * a;
		}

		// Global Variable
		// A function can also access variables defined outside the function
		// In a web page, global variables belong to the window object.
		// Global variables can be used (and changed) by all scripts in the page (and in the window).
		// Variables created without the keyword var, are always global, even if they are created inside a function.

		// Variable Lifetime
		// Global variables live as long as your application (your window / your web page) lives.
		// Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.

		// JavaScript Nested Functions
		// All functions have access to the global scope.  
		// JavaScript supports nested functions. Nested functions have access to the scope "above" them.

		// JavaScript Closures
		// A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

		    var counter = 0;

		/*
		The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.
		The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.
		This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
		This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
		The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.
