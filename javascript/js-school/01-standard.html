		What is JavaScript ?
		Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language.
		It is most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
		JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.
		The ECMA-262 Specification(http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
		JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.

		// JavaScript Standards
		/*
		ECMAScript 3 (ES3) was released in December 1999.
		ECMAScript 4 (ES4) was abandoned.
		ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released in December 2009.
		ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was released in June 2015, and is the latest official version of JavaScript.

		// Client-side JavaScript
		// Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
		// It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
