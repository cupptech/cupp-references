		// for Loop
		// Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

		// for - loops through a block of code a number of times
		for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {
  			// code block to be executed
		}

		// initialExpression is executed before the loop (the code block) starts, is optional.
		// condition defines the condition for running the loop (the code block), is optional. If you omit it, you must provide a break inside the loop. 
		// incrementExpression is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed, is optional.

		// Example
		for (i = 0, j = 10; i < 10; i++){
			console.log(i + j);
		}

		// for/in - loops through all the enumerable properties of an object
		for (variable in object) {
		  	// code block to be executed
		}

		// Example
		for (var i in obj) {
			console.log(obj[i]);
