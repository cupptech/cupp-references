		// Data types
		/*		
		The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
			Six data types that are primitives:
				Boolean
				Null
				Undefined
				Number
				String
				Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
			and Object
		*/

		// Dynamic typing
		// JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language. 
		// Don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time. 
		// The type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed. 
		// You can have the same variable as different types:
		var a = 25;    		// a is now a Number
		var a = "hello"; 	// a is now a String
		var a = true;  		// a is now a Boolean

		// Boolean type
		// Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true, and false.

		// Null type
		// The Null type has exactly one value: null.

		// Undefined type
		// A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.

		// Number type
		// According to the ECMAScript standard, there is only one number type.
		// There is no specific type for integers. 
		// In addition to being able to represent floating-point numbers, the number type has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not-a-number).

		// String type
		// JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it.

		// Symbol type
		// Symbols are new to JavaScript in ECMAScript Edition 6. A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.

		// Objects
		// In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.
		// In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. 
		// Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures.
		// Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a String or a Symbol value.

		// typeof operator
		// Determining types using the typeof operator.

		// Practice
		var a = 5 + 15 + 'hello';
		var a = 'hello' + 5 + 15;
		typeof ''
		typeof 100
		typeof NaN
		typeof true
		typeof undefined
		typeof []
		typeof {}
		typeof function(){}
		typeof null
		null == undefined
		null === undefined
		NaN === NaN
