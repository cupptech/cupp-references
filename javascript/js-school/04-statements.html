		// JavaScript Statements
		// JavaScript statements are called JavaScript code.
		// JavaScript statements are instructions to be executed by computer, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
		var x = 10; 
		var y = 20; 
		var z = x + y;

		// Semicolons ;
		// JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.
		// When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed.
		x = 10; y = 20; z = x + y;

		// JavaScript White Space
		// JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
		// A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ).
		var firstName = "John";
		var firstName="John";

		// JavaScript Line Breaks
		// If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator.
		document.getElementById("id1").innerHTML =
			"Hello World. Have a nice day.";

		// JavaScript Code Blocks
		// JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
		function changeFont(){
			// JavaScript can change the style of an HTML element
			document.getElementById('id001').style.fontSize = '100px';
			document.getElementById('id001').style.color = 'blue';
		}

		// JavaScript Keywords
		// JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
		// JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
