		// Style Guide and Coding Conventions
		// Always use the same coding conventions for all your JavaScript projects.

		// Variable Names
		// Use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions)
		firstName = "John";
		lastName = "Doe";
		getFullName = function(){}

		// Spaces Around Operators
		// Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas:
		var x = y + z;

		// Code Indentation
		// Always use 4 spaces for indentation of code blocks.

		// Statement Rules
		// Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.
		var person = {
		    firstName: "John",
		    lastName: "Doe"
		};

		// General rules for complex (compound) statements:
		/*
		Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
		Use one space before the opening bracket.
		Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
		Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.
		*/
		for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		    x += i;
		}

		// If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma.
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
		    "Hello World.";

		// Naming Conventions
		// Variable and function names written as camelCase
		// Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
		// Hyphens in HTML and CSS
