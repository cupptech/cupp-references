		// The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
		// If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

		// When the JavaScript code interpreter reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
		// The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match
		// Different cases could share the same code block
