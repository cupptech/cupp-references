		// The this Keyword
		// In JavaScript, the thing called this, is the object that "owns" the current code.
		// The value of this, when used in a function, is the object that "owns" the function.

		// Invoking a JavaScript Function
		// The code in a function is not executed when the function is defined. It is executed when the function is invoked.

		// Invoking a Function as a Function
		function add(a, b) {
		    return a + b;
		}
		add(10, 2);  	
		// In a browser the page object is the browser window. The function above automatically becomes a window function.
		// add() and window.add() is the same function.
		// When a function is called without an owner object, the value of this becomes the global object.

		// Invoking a Function as a Method
		// In JavaScript you can define function as object methods.
		var myObject = {
		    firstName:"John",
		    lastName: "Doe",
		    getFullName: function () {
		        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
		    }
		}
		myObject.getFullName();         // Will return "John Doe"
		// The getFullName method is a function. The function belongs to the object. myObject is the owner of the function.
    	// The thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code. In this case the value of this is myObject.

    	// Invoking a Function with a Function Constructor
    	// If a function invocation is preceded with the new keyword, it is a constructor invocation.
    	// The this keyword in the constructor does not have a value.
    	// The value of this will be the new object created when the function is invoked.

		// This is a function constructor:
		function myFunction(arg1, arg2) {
		    this.firstName = arg1;
		    this.lastName  = arg2;
		}

		// This	creates a new object
		var x = new myFunction("John","Doe");    	

		// Invoking a Function with a Function Method
		// call() and apply() are predefined JavaScript function methods. Both methods can be used to invoke a function, and both methods must have the owner object as first parameter.
		add.call(myObject, 10, 2); 
		add.apply(myObject, [10, 2]); 
		// Both methods takes an owner object as the first argument. The only difference is that call() takes the function arguments separately, and apply() takes the function arguments in an array.
		// In JavaScript strict mode, the first argument becomes the value of this in the invoked function, even if the argument is not an object.
		// In "non-strict" mode, if the value of the first argument is null or undefined, it is replaced with the global object.
