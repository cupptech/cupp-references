		// JavaScript Function Definitions
		// JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword.
		// You can use a function declaration or a function expression.

		// Function Declarations
		function functionName(parameters) {
		  // code to be executed
		}		

		// Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).
		// Since a function declaration is not an executable statement, it is not common to end it with a semicolon.

		// Function Expressions
		// A function expression can be stored in a variable.
		var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};
		var z = x(4, 3);
		// Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.
		// The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement.

		// Function Hoisting
		// Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.
		// Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function declarations.
		// Because of this, JavaScript functions can be called before they are declared:
		add(3, 5);

		function add(x, y) {
		    return x + y;
		}
		// Functions defined using an expression are not hoisted.

		// Self-Invoking Functions (IIFE)
		// Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().
		// You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression.
		(function () {
		    console.log('hello world');
		})();

		// Functions Can Be Used as Values
		var x = add(3, 5) * 10;

		// Functions are Objects
		// The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "function" for functions.
		// But, JavaScript functions can best be described as objects.
		// JavaScript functions have both properties and methods.
