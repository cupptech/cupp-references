		// JavaScript Best Practices
		// Avoid Global Variables
		// All variables used in a function should be declared as local variables, put all declarations at the top of each script or function.
		// It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them.

		// Declare and initiate at the beginning
		var firstName = "",
		    lastName = "",
		    price = 0,
		    discount = 0,
		    fullPrice = 0,
		    myArray = [],
		    myObject = {};

		// Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects.
		var x = "John";             
		var y = new String("John");
		(x === y) // is false because x is a string and y is an object.

		// Use === Comparison
		// The == comparison operator always converts (to matching types) before comparison.
		// The === operator forces comparison of values and type:		
		0 == "";        // true
		1 == "1";       // true
		1 == true;      // true

		0 === "";       // false
		1 === "1";      // false
		1 === true;     // false		

		// Avoid Using eval()
		// The eval() function is used to run text as code. In almost all cases, it should not be necessary to use it.
		// Because it allows arbitrary code to be run, it also represents a security problem.
