		// JavaScript Objects
		// JavaScript objects are containers for named values.
		// The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
		// You define a JavaScript object with an object literal:
		var person = {
			firstName:"John", 
			lastName:"Doe", 
			city:'San Francisco', 
			getFullName: function(){
				return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
			}
		};

		// Using the JavaScript Keyword new to create an object
		var person = new Object();
		person.firstName = "John";
		person.lastName = "Doe";

		// Using object constructor to create an object
		function person(first, last) {
		    this.firstName = first;
		    this.lastName = last;
		}		
		var john = new person("John", "Doe");
		var mike = new person("Mike", "Doe");

		// Object Properties
		// The name:values pairs are called properties.

		// Object Methods
		// Methods are stored in properties as function definitions, are actions that can be performed on objects.

		// Accessing Object Properties
		objectName.propertyName
		objectName["propertyName"]
		objectName.methodName()

		// Deleting Properties
		// The delete keyword deletes a property from an object.
		// The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.
		delete objectName.propertyName

		// Prototype Properties
		// JavaScript objects inherit the properties of their prototype.
		// The delete keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the prototype.

		// JavaScript for...in Loop
		// The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.
		for (variable in object) {
		    code to be executed
		}

		// Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects.
		// When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object.
		// That complicate your code and slow down execution speed.
		var x = new String(); 
		var y = new Number(); 
		var z = new Boolean();

		// The this Keyword
		/*
		In JavaScript, the thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code.
		The value of this, when used in a function, is the object that "owns" the function.
		The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.
		The this keyword in an object constructor does not have a value. It is only a substitute for the new object.
		The value of this will become the new object when the constructor is used to create an object.
		*/

		// JavaScript Objects are Mutable
		// Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
		var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:20}
		var x = person;
		x.age = 10;
