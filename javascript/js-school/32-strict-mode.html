		// "use strict";
		// The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).
		// It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
		// The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
		// For example, with strict mode, you can not use undeclared variables.

		// Declaring Strict Mode
		// Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a JavaScript or a JavaScript function.
		// Declared at the beginning of a JavaScript file, it has global scope (all code will execute in strict mode).
		"use strict";

		// Why Strict Mode?
		/*
		Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.

		Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.

		As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.

		In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties.

		In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.

		// Not Allowed in Strict Mode

		// Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
		"use strict";
		x = 3.33;

		// Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.
		"use strict";
		var x = 3.14;
		delete x;  

		// Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:
		"use strict";
		function x(p1, p1) {};

		// Octal numeric literals are not allowed:
		"use strict";
		var x = 010; 

		// Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:
		"use strict";
		delete Object.prototype;

		// The string "arguments" cannot be used as a variable:
		"use strict";
		var arguments = 3.33;

		//The with statement is not allowed:
		"use strict";
		with (Math){x = random()};
